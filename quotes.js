            year: "1848",
            author: "Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels",
            quotes: ["A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of Communism.", "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.", "All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man at last is compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.", "But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons - the modern working class - the proletarians.", "The essential condition for the existence, and for the sway of the bourgeois class, is the formation and augmentation of capital; the condition for capital is wage labour. Wage labour rests exclusively on competition between the labourers.", "What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, is its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.", "The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property.", "In bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to accrue accumulated labour. In Communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.", "In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present: in Communist society, the present dominates the past.", "You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, private property is already done away for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence to the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.", "Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriation.", "The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.", "In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.", "In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things.", "The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. ", "The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.", "WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!"]

            year: "1532",
            author: "Niccolo Machiavelli",
            quotes: ["Remember what the doctors tell us about tuberculosis: in it’s early stages it’s easy to cure and hard to diagnose, but if you don’t spot it and treat it, as time goes by it gets easy to diagnose and hard to cure. So it is with affairs of the state. See trouble in advance and you can clear it up quickly. Miss it, and by the time it’s big enough for everyone to see it will be too late to do anything about it.", "to help another ruler to grow powerful is to prepare your own ruin; because it takes flair or military strength to build up a new power, and both will seem threatening to the person who has benefited from them.", "It’s easy to convince people of something, but hard to keep them convinced. So when they stop believing in you, you must be in a position to force them to believe.", "Most of all, though, a ruler should have the kind of relationship with his subjects where nothing that can happen, good or bad, will force him to change his approach, because if hard times demand it, your cruelty will come too late, while any concessions you make will be seen as wrung out of you and no one will be impressed.", "In every city one finds these two conflicting political positions: there are the common people who are eager not to be ordered around and oppressed by the noble families, and there are the nobles who are eager to oppress the common people and order them around. These oppressing impulses will lead to one of three different situations: a monarchy, a republic or anarchy.", "Seeing that they can’t control the people, the wealthy families begin to concentrate prestige on one of their number and make him king so as to be able to get what they want in his shadow. Likewise, the people, seeing that they can’t resist the power of the nobles, concentrate prestige on one citizen and make him king so that his authority will protect them.", "A king who comes to power with the help of the rich nobles will have more trouble keeping it than the king who gets there with the support of the people, because he will be surrounded by men who consider themselves his equals, and that will make it hard for him to give them orders or to manage affairs as he wants.", "The worst a king can expect if the people turn hostile is that they will desert him; but when the nobles turn against him, he has to fear not only desertion, but a direct attack. The nobles are smarter, they see further ahead, they always move early enough to save their skins, ingratiating themselves with whoever they think will turn out the winner.", "if you always want to play the good man in a world where most people are not good, you’ll end up badly. Hence, if a ruler wants to survive, he’ll have to learn to stop being good, at least when the occasion demands.", "Since a ruler can’t be generous and show it without putting himself at risk, if he’s sensible he won’t mind getting a reputation for meanness.", "Generosity practised out of real good will, as it should be, risks passing unnoticed and you won’t escape a reputation for meanness.", "A ruler leading his armies and living on plunder, pillage and extortion is using other people’s money and had better be generous with it, otherwise his soldiers won’t follow him.", "Nothing consumes itself so much as generosity, because while you practise it you’re losing the wherewithal to go on practising it. Either you fall into poverty and are despised for it, or, to avoid poverty, you become grasping and hateful. Above all else a king must guard against being despised and hated. Generosity leads to both. It’s far more sensible to keep a reputation for meanness, which carries a stigma but doesn’t rouse people’s hatred, than to strive to be seen as generous and find at the end of the day that you’re thought of as grasping, something that carries a stigma and gets you hated too.", "The lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox cannot defend himself from wolves. One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten wolves.", "I’m sure every leader would wish to be seen as compassionate rather than cruel. All the same he must be careful not to use his compassion unwisely.", "A ruler mustn’t worry about being labelled cruel when it’s a question of keeping his subjects loyal and united; using a little exemplary severity, he will prove more compassionate than the leader whose excessive compassion leads to public disorder, muggings and murder.", "a ruler will also be respected when he is a genuine friend and a genuine enemy, that is, when he declares himself unambiguously for one side and against the other. This policy will always bring better results than neutrality.", "In general, a ruler must never imagine that any decision he takes is safe; on the contrary he should reckon that any decision is potentially dangerous.", "There is no other way to guard yourself against flattery than by making men understand that telling you the truth will not offend you.", "it’s a common shortcoming not to prepare for the storm while the weather is fair", "My opinion on the matter is this: it’s better to be impulsive than cautious; fortune is female and if you want to stay on top of her you have to slap and thrust. You’ll see she’s more likely to yield that way than men who go about her coldly. And being a woman she likes her men young, because they’re not so cagey, they’re wilder and more daring when they master her.", "So now Italy lies, half-dead, waiting to see who will heal her wounds and put an end to the devastation of Lombardy, the extortionate taxation of Tuscany and Naples, who will clean up the sores that have festered too long. You can see the country is praying God to send someone to save her from the cruelty and barbarity of these foreigners. You can see she is ready and willing to march beneath a flag, if only someone would raise one up.","Never attempt to win by force what can be won by deception."]

When the bourgeois sees it in that form he takes to flight, and if his flight is rapid enough it may carry him to Fascism.", "tea-drinking is 'pagan', beer-drinking is 'Christian' and coffee is the 'puritan's opium'", "the champion of progress is also the champion of anachronisms.", "A generation ago every intelligent person was in some sense a revolutionary; nowadays it would be nearer the mark to say that every intelligent person is a reactionary.", "If only the sandals and pistachio-coloured shirts could be put in a pile and burnt, and every vegetarian, teetotaller, and creeping Jesus sent home to Welwyn Garden City to do his yoga exercises quietly."]

        //     quotes: ["Taigi žinant, kad net paukšteliams būdingas laisvės pojūtis, nereikia stebėtis, jog žmogus, kilniausias iš visų būtybių ir vienintelis Dievo sutvertas pilniausiai laisvei, taip aistringai jos siekia, o vergijos jungo kratosi net gyvybės [kaina]. Vergaujantis žmogus, teisingai sakė Ciceronas, negyvena tikro gyvenimo.", "Tačiau yra ir tokių sugedusių, ir tokių piktos valios žmonių, kad jie tų ydų, ir taip naikinančių visokią laisvę, nesidrovi papuošti pačios laisvės vardu. Daugelis mano, kad jie tik tada naudojasi tikra ir tvirta laisve, kai grėsmingu ir žiauriu veidu gąsdina kokį nors silpnesnį už save žmogelį, kai, pamatę lengvai nuskriaudžiamą, nesusilaiko neįvykdę skriaudos ir taip visus žiauriai savo valdžia kankina.", "Apskritai vyksta taip, kaip gražiai savo knygoje Valstybė rodo Platonas: kadangi kiekvienas nukrypimas virsta priešybe per didelė laisvė išsigimsta į per didelę nelaisvę. Juk jei yra kokia nors valstybė, kurioje galima daryti kas patinka ir visai nepaisoma įstatymų, tokia padėtis tik stiprina galingųjų įžūlumą bei geidulį viską sau glemžti. Tai, žinoma, silpniesiems ir vargšams atneša tikrą vergiją.", "Taip geri įstatymai visais atžvilgiais stiprina visų žmonių laisvę: jie niekam neleidžia piktnaudžiauti savo gėrybėmis ir baudžia tą, kuris pažeidžia savo bei kitų laisvę", "Argi laisvu laikysi tokį žmogų, kurį bet kas gali nupirkti ir paskersti it kokį gyvulį?", "tik tokioje valstybėje, kur visiems taikoma vienoda teisė, piliečiai gali būti vadinami laisvais.", " kuriai nors žmonių grupei suteikti daugiau nei kitiems teisių ar valios ir nesulyginti visų pagal tuos pačius įstatymus – tai, mano nuomone, skirtina greičiau nežmoniškumui ir barbariškam žiaurumui, o ne teisingai, įstatymais pagrįstai santvarkai.", "Iš tikrųjų niekas tegul nesitiki, kad valstybėje, kur atleidžiami varžtai galingesniesiems spausti žemesniuosius, ilgai išsilaikys taika ir ramybė. Juk sukilimai, nesutarimai bei karai dažniausiai kyla dėl tokių aplinkybių; taip suardoma piliečių vienybė, sunaikinama santarvė, kuri tik viena geriausiai palaiko amžinus žmonių siekius, ir galų gale dėl to visai žlunga valstybė", "Bent iš dviejų dalykų junginio, kaip liudija Aristotelis, susideda kilmingumas, t. y. pirmiausia iš šaunumo ir turtų. Tačiau neretai pasitaiko, – net ir mūsų patirtis tai rodo, – kad įtakingam vardui įgyti net nebuvo paisoma šaunumo; paprastai daugiausia reikšmės turėdavo tik turtas arba senolių šlovė.", "Tai, kas prieštarauja teisingam proto sprendimui ir neatitinka žmonėms Dievo įdiegto širdies balso, negali turėti nesulaužomo įstatymo tvirtumo"]
